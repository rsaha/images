This information is primarily used to assist you in making reservations quickly without having to type in the same information repeatedly.</p>
<h3>Online Surveys</h3>
<p>Guided Gateway values opinions and comments from members, so we frequently conduct online surveys. Participation in these surveys is entirely voluntary and optional. Typically, the information is aggregated, and used to make improvements to the GuidedGateway.com site and its services and to develop appealing content, features and promotions for GuidedGateway.com site members. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey.</p>
<h3>Promotions &amp; Sweepstakes</h3>
<p>Guided Gateway frequently sponsors promotions and sweepstakes to give GuidedGateway.com site members the opportunity to win great travel and travel &#8211; related prizes. Information collected by us for such activities may include contact information and survey questions. We use contact information to notify contest winners and survey information to develop promotions and product improvements to the GuidedGateway.com site.</p>
<h3>Automatic Logging of Session Data</h3>
<p>We automatically log generic information about your computer&#8217;s connection to the Internet, which we call &#8220;session data&#8221;, that is anonymous and not linked to any personal information. Session data consists of things such as IP address, operating system and type of browser software being used and the activities conducted by the user while on GuidedGateway.com site. We collect session data because it helps us analyse such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems. Although such information does not identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor&#8217;s Internet Service Provider (ISP), and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.</p>

There are many myths circulating about cookies, but you should know that cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to do such things as run programs on your computer, plant viruses or harvest your personal information. The use of cookies is very common on the Internet and Guided Gateway&#8217;s use of cookies is similar to that of such sites as MakeMyTrip, Expedia and Orbitz, as well as Yahoo!, CNN.com and other reputable online companies.</p>

Please be very careful, responsible, and alert with this information, especially whenever you&#8217;re online.</p>
<p>In addition to the circumstances described above, Guided Gateway may disclose the GuidedGateway.com site member information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of Guided Gateway or any or all of its affiliates, associates, employees, directors or officers or when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. In addition, if Guided Gateway or substantially all of its assets are acquired, our customer information will most likely also be transferred in connection with such acquisition<br />
